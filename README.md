**Serverless + Microservices = ♥**

Lever OS is in **beta**. Please report bugs via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/leveros/leveros/issues)!

Deploy your service locally

```bash
$ lever deploy
```

This takes the whole current directory, archives it and deploys it onto Lever, in an environment that was created by default: `dev.lever`.

###### Invoke via CLI

```bash
$ lever invoke lever://dev.lever/phoneService/createSubscribe '"905054146201"'

```
